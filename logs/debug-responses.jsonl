The main product is called “reMarkable 2”, a device that provides an almost identical writing and reading experience to paper, but with additional features only made possible via technology. The device’s functionality is particularly focused on the writi ng experience, endeavoring to preserve the benefits handwriting has on memory and focus. This ambition is reflected in reMarkable’s vision – “Better thinking through technology.” The Group distributes its products in over 50 countries, with North America and Europe being the largest markets. The majority of sales originate through reMarkable’s own web shop, whereas sales via third parties make up an increasing proportion of revenues as part of the Group ’s distribution channel strategy. Production is conducted primarily in China, with distribution from warehouses in Hong Kong, the Netherlands, Lithuania and Mexico. Letter to stakeholders 2023 has been an outstanding year for reMarkable. We embarked on a highly successful retail sales roll - out and unveiled our new product offering, the Type Folio. In addition, we have expanded our software ecosystem – making progress on a seamless workflow and better thinking across all your devices. During the year, we have also continued to scale the organization, investing heavily into new product development while making substantial improvements to our operating model. reMarkable 2 continues to lead the paper tablet category, and during Q4 we crossed the threshold of more than 2 million paper tablets sold since the launch of reMarkable 1. This is a testament to the strength of our brand and value proposition of the produ ct. Word - of - mouth recommendations remain one of our most important sales - drivers, and this gives us continued confidence that we are barely scratching the surface of a very large addressable market. Our Connect subscription offering provides a unique platf orm on which to continuously add more value to the reMarkable user experience. With a rapidly growing base of nearly 700,000 subscribers as of year - end , this will be a core area of investment in the years ahead.

Both to attract new customers and to serve our existing customers better, we introduced the Type Folio, a slim keyboard that elegantly attaches to reMarkable 2. The launch was accompanied by mobile and desktop applications that enable users to capture critical notes when our tablet is not the most convenient option. For on - the - go and at - the - desk notes, users can capture ideas, no matter where they are or what device they are wo rking on – fully integrated with our tablet. In mid - October, reMarkable completed a NOK 500m Norwegian bond issue, which marked our first entry into public capital markets. This additional financing strengthens our ability to develop and commercialize new products. As we grow, especially with third - p arty retail sales, the bond proceeds will help with increased working capital needs. The bond will be listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange during the second half of 2024 and as a consequence of this we have changed our accounting standard from Norwegian Gener ally Accepted Accounting Principles (NGAAP) to the International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) while also changing our functional and reporting currency to US Dollars. While we are proud of what we accomplished last year, we are depending on our employees to deliver even more in the coming years. I continue to be impressed with the dedication of the team, and I am optimistic that we can create significantly more business value as we align the team to our business strategy and focus on employee engagement. Our employees are the source of our value creation. However, it will be our customers who ultimately judge the value of our work. I see opportunities for us to place the customer at the center of everything that we do. This means relentlessly focusing on t he end - to - end customer experience so they both love us and tell their friends about us. With employees enabled to create and deliver more value, and with a more customer - centric culture, we can continue on the successful path that those who came before me have started.

After cost of materials, the margins reflected a healthy 48% and 50% respectively. The 2 pp. decline is partly explained by re turn provisioning on the back of a changed sales mix along with costs incurred as remarkable continues to expand into a new sales channel. EBITDA EBITDA came in at a record high of USD 38 m, compared to USD 4 m for 2022 ( 896 % year - over - year growth). The robust performance comes as a result of increased revenues in combination with a relative reduction in sales and advertising expenditure (as a % of revenue). This positive development offsets the ramp - up in the operating cost base to support reMarkable’s continued development of new products and markets. Research and development D evelopment costs are related to improvements made on existing products and development of new products, accessories and software amounted to a total of USD 16.5 m during 2023 (2022: USD 13.5m). Additions to software during 2023 and 2022 are mainly related to the enterprise resource planning (ERP), supply chain and customer management systems’ implementation. The Group performed significant integrations between the systems to enable proper data fl ows between the aforementioned systems, and other systems held the Group. Total expenditure for these projects, excluding ongoing costs to access to the cloud systems, amounted to USD 7.2m in 2023, and an additional USD 4.2m in 2022.

Cash flow from f inancing activities Net cash flow from financing activities of USD 27m in 2023 largely represents the remaining proceeds from the NOK 500m bond issue post repayment of existing bank debt. Liquidity As at year - end 2023, the reMarkable Group held USD 93 m in cash and equivalents, compared to USD 53m for 2022. The strong liquidity improvement has been achieved through the positive financial results, positive net working capital changes along with the proceeds from the bond issue. reMarkable’s net cash position was USD 44m at year - end 2023.

To counter sourcing complexities, reMarkable has a dedicated team that collaborates directly with suppliers throughout our value chain and regularly takes strategic measures to ensure access to critical input factors and priority with suppliers. The latter may on a regular basis require us to maintain a significant inventory of finished goods and critical longlead components, which increases the Group ’s working capital needs. Liquidity risk reMarkable manages its liquidity risk by regularly monitoring its liquidity needs for working capital, and strategic investments, both for short - term and long - term needs, and periodically updates estimations through rolling forecasts. During the year we completed a NOK 500m bond issue, which will strengthen the Group s ability to develop and commercialize new products as well as help with increased working capital needs following the growth in third - party retail. Moreover, reMarkable has access to additional sources of liquidity, from its supply chain financing facilit y, another multifunctional currency line, and potential tap issues through its bond. As the Group continues to grow, fixed expenditure also increases. With one primary revenue stream, there is an inherent uncertainty in cash flow from operations which is currently our main source of financing future growth. The recurring revenue contribution from the Connect subscription base partially offsets this but is as of yet at a limited scale. The lead - time on paper tablet production means the Group must place orders before future demand is known, and this exposes the Group to the risk of future dem and not aligning with projections. The Group can manage this through a combination of postponing inventory commitments, reducing expenditures and managing working capital and carefully monitoring and projecting its financial position as a central part of our business planning cycle Market risk reMarkable’s revenue is affected by standard economic trends and consumer purchase patterns, including seasonality, and periods that typically involve discounted offers.

The Group has anticipated this for some time and sees itself as well positioned to maintain a leading role in this emerging product category. In response to this new competitive environment, reMarkable has initiated many cross - company efforts to both strengthen the value proposition of its products and services and increase its market penetration. Credit risk The risk of losses on receivables is considered low, as the customer base is large and diverse and the Group ’s payment providers are well - established, reputable companies which release funds continuously within 3 - 7 days after customer purchase. The risk of losses from receivables on web shop orders resides with the payment provider and is reflected in the fees f or their services. reMarkable’s retail distributor agreements typically involve an element of credit payment, but the Group assesses the risk of losses on receivables to be low on the back of only entering agreements with players that have undergone a counterparty check. In relation to an increased growth in the retail segment, the Group will make ongoing assessments of the payment terms provided, the credit risk entailed, and any other instruments that can be used to mitigate risk.;","response":"[\n  {\n    \"company\": \"reMarkable\",\n    \"bonds_issued\": [\n      {\n        \"value\": \"NOK 500m\",\n        \"years\": []\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]"}

Our main impact The double materiality assessment The double materiality assessment was conducted in four phases; understand, identify, evaluate and decide. Understand: we gathered information to understand reMarkable’s sustainability context, assessing reports from industry experts on sustainability, reMarkable’s value chain, peers and other relevant sources.

This step makes it possible to compare different sustainability topics against each other, as for example comparing the impact of pollution from manufacture on one sid e, to breaches of consumer privacy on the other. Decide: After giving each impact, risk or opportunity a magnitude, we decided on a threshold for these to be considered material, or not material. This process output was an impact scoring, and finally resulted in identifying the most material sustainability topic s for reMarkable. Some of the topics we identified as most material are climate change mitigation, anti - corruption, resource use and circular economy, information security, and human rights in our value chain. Most of the impacts, risks and opportunities reMarkable face as a company, takes place throughout our value chain. Circularity We strive to minimize the lifetime impact of our products and services, making everlasting products and services that can pass through multiple life cycles, using recycled and reused materials produced with renewable energy. Re - using products is one of the most efficient methods to reduce the environmental impact of a product. Due to this, reMarkable is focusing on extending the lifetime of our reMarkable 2 device by both conducting refurbishment and repair. Refurbishment would mean that when a used device is returned from a customer,the device is tested according to the same quality requirements as a new device, re - packed and re - sold to another customer or used as a replacement product. Some products also require repair before they could be sold as a refurbished device. The device is repaired, and then follows the refurbishment process. Products that are returned within our satisfaction guarantee period or warranty period are eligible for repair and refurbishment, and these are sold in selected geographical markets. Through refurbishment and repair we are able to extend the lifetime of our products.

We will continue to work with circularity in 2024. The work will include setting and implementing strategies to promote circular outcomes, and spans across material usage in our products to efficient repair and refurbishment solutions. Social impact As a company with a global value chain, it is critical to be aware of the impact we have on the societies around and workers in our value chain activities. Therefore, we believe in close collaboration with our suppliers and stakeholders. We work with our s uppliers to define goals and actions that support our efforts towards sustainability, and have continuous dialogue with them to provide support and feedback. Supply chain When we choose suppliers, through the Request for Proposal (RFP) processes, potential suppliers are evaluated based on their capabilities within sustainability, and sustainability commitments are defined as part of our process. We aim to work with supplier s sharing our values and concerns for the future. reMarkable is taking several steps to ensure that human rights and decent working conditions are respected throughout the supply chain, all the way down to raw material sub - suppliers. We have prioritized work on three main areas in 2023. Supplier Code of Conduct: Our Supplier Code of Conduct addresses topics such as labor rights, health and safety, environment and ethical governance. We have updated the policy to reflect our efforts and expectations we have to the suppliers. During 2023 and continuing into 2024, we are working to ensure that all direct first tier suppliers 1 understand and sign the Group ’s Supplier Code of Conduct, and commit to work with suppliers tiers 2 - n to ensure they, at a minimum, follow the same standard. Not accepting the Supplier Code of Conduct would disqualify a supplier in a RFP process. ESG Due Diligence : All potential suppliers have to go through an ESG Due Diligence Tool, which identifies potential risks related to environmental, social or governance aspects. All our current direct first tier suppliers are also onboarded on this platform, which allows us to efficiently monitor and collaborate with our suppliers on improvement points. Norwegian Transparency Act : We request information on how our suppliers and business partners work with fundamental human rights and decent working conditions. Our suppliers are also requested to share the same information from their supply chain - all the way to the extraction of ra w materials. We use that information to conduct risk assessments to identify and mitigate potential and actual negative impact we can have on these important areas. This is extensive work, and we are constantly striving to impro ve our work in the area. 1 Tier 1 suppliers refer to those with whom we maintain a direct financial relationship, whereby transactions are conducted directly with them.

The analysis is based on the Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, developed by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative (GHG protocol). This is the most imp ortant standard for measuring GHG emissions and was the basis for the ISO standard 14064 - I. 5 Scope 1 are all direct emission sources where the organisation has operational control. Scope 2 are emissions from electricity and district heating purchased by the Group . Scope 3 are emissions related to the Group ’s value chain, and is not owned or controlled directly by the company.

These two aspects combined entailed a higher emission for this category. Downstream transportation and distribution, mainly consisting of air freight, represents 10% of the total emissions for 2023. Even though the number of sold units increased for 2023, the downstream transportation and distribution processes have undergone e nhancements resulting in a reduction in transportation emissions. While the exact cause of this reduction is not explicitly determined, it is likely attributed to the concerted efforts towards sustainability initiatives and the improved logistical efficien cy implemented by DHL. These efforts encompass various factors such as optimizing shipment weight, streamlining routes, and implementing eco - friendly transport modes. Going forward, we will use the data collected as a baseline for setting climate targets and work to radically reduce our GHG emissions in the coming years. 6 The data for business travels in 2022 were not available, but we estimate them to be significantly higher than in 2021 due to increased number and distance of business travels DocuSign Envelope ID: 254A60C2-8FCD-41AB-8B23-AFDE2AFF3494[PAGE_END:13] [PAGE_START:14]reMarkable Invest Group and reMarkable Invest AS 14 Parent company financial review reMarkable Invest issued a bond denominated in NOK, for a nominal amount of NOK 500 million.

This note provides an overview of the areas that involved a higher degree of judgement or complexity, and of items which are more likely to be materially adjusted due to estimates and assumptions turning out to be different when, and to the extent that, th e uncertainty is resolved . These areas are as follows: • capitalization of integrations and implementation costs incurred in cloud service contracts .

As indicated in the basis of preparation (see Section 1.2 ), these are the first consolidated financial statements by the Group, and therefore the reM arkable Invest Group has performed consolidation for comparative periods following the general consolidation rules under IFRS 10. 2.2 Foreign currency 2.2.1 Functional currency The reMarkable Invest Group present s its financial statements in USD, which is also the functional currency of the companies within it. Accounting judgements – determination of functional currency M anagement has assessed the functional currency of reMa rk able AS . Based on an analysis of it s primary indicators ( i.e ., sales and operating expenses), it is concluded that the dominating currency is USD. This is mainly supported by degree of sales nominated in USD with respect to other currencies , the competitive force of the US in these markets, and the vast majority of production costs of inventory being nominated in USD. For reMarkable Invest AS (Holding company in the Group) it is concluded that this company has no activities of its own (other than holding financing) and therefore it is regarded as an extension of its subsidiary , reMarkable AS . The Group will reassess the functional currency of the C ompany when there is a change in events and conditions which determine the primary economic environment assessment. 2.2.2 Foreign currency transactions T ransactions in foreign currency are recorded, on initial recognition , at the spot rate at which the transaction qualifies for recognition under IFRS , unless applying average rates for the month would give a fair approximation to using the actual rates. For monetary items, the difference between the spot exchange rate at reporting date (or settlement date) and initial rate is recognize d in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income , at each reporting date and until the moment of the settlement.

Operating segments are components of the Group regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) to assess performance and be able to allocate resources. The CODM in reMarkable is the board of directors . The reMarkable Invest Group as a whole is operated as a single segment. See note 3 .2 for a disaggregation of revenue based on the major class of products in the Group . During 202 3 , revenue s from one of the Group’s customer s amounted to more than 10% of the Group ’s total revenues , totaling USD 48 million. Revenue from external customers in Norway amounted to 0.7 % (2022: 0.8 %) , and non - current assets to USD 40 million (2022: USD 29 million ) . Non - current assets held by the Group outside Norway are mainly located in Hong - Kong and constitute production machinery.

The majority of revenue from contracts with customers arise from the sale of the reMarkable device and its accessories from both the reMarkable website (directly to end - user) and through retailers and distributors. During the periods presented in the financial statements, the Group ’s sales of tablets included the right for users access to the subscription offering ( C o nnect ) for up to one year , extended warranty period and extended return period . Services mentioned other than access to cloud cannot be obtained separately from the purchase of a tablet. The Group ’s revenue can be disaggregated based on lines of product considering mainly the n ature and uncertainties within each of these categories. Accounting policies Identification of contracts with customers and performance obligations The Group acts as a principal on the sale of its products to customers. T wo performance obligations are broadly identified in the Group : goods (mainly tablets and accessories) and access to cloud - based solutions ( bundled or not with additional services). Performance obligations for the sale of goods are sati s fied at a point in time, mainly based on when risks are transferred to customers , when there is right to payment, and ph y sical delivery has been completed in accordance with contractual terms (incoterms or otherwise sta ted).

Goods delivered by reMarkable are typically prepaid when sales are directly made to end customers, and it ranges between 10 to 30 days after invoice date for retailers and distributors. Transaction price Irrespective of the sales channel, the transaction price for the sale of goods includes a variable element from the expected returns by customers (see Section 6.4 for further disclosures) . Goods sold with a right of return are recognize d as ‘refund liabilities’ within ‘other current liabilities’ , with a corresponding decrease in revenue for the period. T he right - of - return asset (‘return assets ’ ) is recognize d as ‘ other current assets ’ with a corresponding decrease in the ‘cost of materials ’ of the Group. For countries where taxes and duties on imports are included in final price to customers, the Group has applied judgement and concluded that it acts as an agent for such amounts, and therefore presents revenue net from payments to tax authorities. Judgement considered factors triggering the payment of the tax, risks held by reMarkable and the tax being based on sales price of the good. The Group typically incur s payments to its customers for placement services (physically or in its clients’ own sites, analogous to slotting fees) as a reduction in revenue. Otherwise, the Group recognize s consideration to customers in the same way as normal purchase of services, and typically include content creation and optimi z ation. T he transaction price for the sale of goods and services in the Group also contain s elements of variable consideration such as sales bonuses, discounts and rebate s, which are recognize d as reductions of revenue based on the expected values , but for which the Group considers no significant judgement s or estimates are involved. Allocation of transaction price to performance obligations As indicated above, sales of tablets include some attached services.

After initial recognition, borrowings are measured at amortized cost. Any difference between the net proceeds and the redemption a mount is recognize d in profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Supply chain financing The Group presents amounts held from its supply chain facilities as part of it s borrowings. In deciding this presentation, the Group considers the nature, commercial purpose and specific terms of the agreement. For presentation in the statement of cash flows, see Section 2.3. The following table disaggregates interest - bearing loans held by the Group: The increase in borrowings during 2023 is due to the issuance of a bond for a nominal amount of NOK 500 million bond , whose nominal amount has been reduced by th e directly attributable costs from issuing the bond . 5.3.1 Main terms and conditions Bond agreement The bond was issued in October 2023, for a nominal amount of NOK 500 million , and accruing interests at 3 months NIBOR plus 7% margin . The Group does not pay any principal until maturity date (October 202 7) , and interest is paid quarterly.

The Group has the possibility to early repay its bond at any time , with certain compensations to bondholders for lost interes t, and the possibility to early repay up to 35% of the bond upon the Group’s equity becoming liste d . These options are found to be not closely related to the host contract, however it has been concluded that these options have negligible value for the Group in the current circumstances . The bondholders also have the possibility o f early repayment of the bond due to change of control or unfavorable tax events . These options are considered to be closely related to the host agreement and therefore they have not been separately recognised by the Group.

Subsequently, right - of - use assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairments and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liabilities. Depreciation of the right - of - use asset is carried out using the straight - line method over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the underlying asset.

The Group’s senior management oversees the management of these risks. 5.6.1 Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an obligation , leading to a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities ( primarily trade receivables) and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions , foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments.;","response":"[\n  {\n    \"companyName\": \"reMarkable Invest Group\",\n    \"years\": [2023, 2022],\n    \"leaseLiabilities\": {\n      \"2023\": \"136\",\n      \"2022\": \"1 495\"\n    },\n    \"interestExpense\": {\n      \"2023\": \"62\",\n      \"2022\": \"92\"\n    },\n    \"shortTermLeaseExpense\": {\n      \"2023\": \"4 338\",\n      \"2022\": \"3 108\"\n    },\n    \"depreciationExpense\": {\n      \"2023\": \"1 504\",\n      \"2022\": \"1 342\"\n    },\n    \"totalCashOutflows\": {\n      \"2023\": \"5 709\",\n      \"2022\": \"4 278\"\n    },\n    \"leaseCommitments\": {\n      \"2023\": \"36 496\",\n      \"2022\": \"37 663\"\n    }\n  }\n]"}

The risk of losses on trade receivables is considered low, as the customer base is large and diverse and the Group’s payment providers are well - established, reputable companies which release funds continuously within 3 - 7 days after customer purchase. The r isk of losses from receivables on web shop orders resides with the payment provider and is reflected in the fees for their services. reMarkable’s retail distributor agreements typically involve an element of credit payment, but the Group assesses the risk of losses on receivables to be low on the back of only entering agreements with players that have undergone a counterparty check. In relation to an increased growth in the sales to retailers and distributors , the Group makes ongoing assessments of the payment terms provided, the credit risk entailed, and any other instruments that can be used to mitigate risk. The Group ’s trade receivab les are not generally covered by credit insurance. The Group follows up the ageing of the trade receivables with customers on an ongoing basis. As of the 31 December 2023, 99.7 % of trade receivables were either not due or due less than 30 days (31 December 2022: 95.6%) . Cash and cash equivalents The Group manages its exposure to ward s credit risks of individual banks by considering the amount of deposits that can be held in a single bank , considering among other factors the credit rating of its banks. The Group is also exposed to credit risks from its cash equivalents , which are amounts held in payment processor companies. The Group performs an individual analysis of each agreement with payment processors, and regularly follows up credit ratings reports of such companies. Other non - current assets Other non - current assets mainly relate to its deposits for leases (see Section 5 .2) . These deposits are established in specific bank accounts for such purpose , and therefore is not exposed to individual credit risks of the lease provider . 5.6.2 Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group manages its liquidity risk by regularly monitoring its liquidity needs for working capital, and strategical investments , both for short - term and long - term needs , and periodically updates estimations through rolling forecasts. Additionally, the Group has acce s s to additional liquidity , from its supply chain financing facility, another multifunctional currency line, and additional tap issues to its bond (see Note 5.3 for further details).

Market risk for the Group comprises two types of risk: currency risk and interest rate risk . 5.6.3.1 Interest rate risk Interest rate risk for the Group is the risk that future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group is mainly exposed to interest rate risk from its interest - bearing debt, including the bond and the supply chain financi ng, as these instruments are exposed to changes in NIBOR. Part of the Group’s exposure to interest rates is compensated by holdings of cash and cash equivalents. The Group does not use any derivatives to hedge against the variability on interest rates . The following table demonstrates the sensitivit y of the Group to a reasonably possible change in interest rates . With all other variables held constant, the Group’s profit after tax and equity is affected through the impact on floating rate borrowings, as follows : The table above does not illustrate the offsetting effects that the holdings of cash and cash equivalents by the Group . 5.6.3.2 Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group is exposed to currency risk in its financial assets and liabilities where the functional currency of the compan y in the Group is different to the currency in which the asset will be paid, or the liability discharged. The Group’s policy in this respect is to have a natural hedge, by which the Group match, to the extent possible , inflows and outflows of the currency. The Group sells its products in multiple countries with pricing in local currencies. While the majority of the sales is in USD, t he largest exposures to foreign currency with respect to sales and trade receivables consist of the EUR , GBP and, to a much lesser extent, NOK . The Company’s expenditure commitments and a large part of the cost base ( disregarding inventory cost, which is mainly denominated in USD ) in foreign currency going forward will generally be nominated in NOK . Therefore, changes in the NOK/USD exchange rate have a direct impact on the Group’s profitability as a stronger NOK will increase the Group’s fixed cost base and vice versa . The Group is also exposed to currency risks from its bond being de nominated in NOK (see Section 5.3), while the functional currency of the companies in the Group being USD .

Under the Norwegian Acc ounting Act §3 - 4, the company has the availability to chose NOK as accounting currency and has therefore decided to apply NOK as both accounting currency and presentation currency. Tax The tax charge in the profit and loss account consists of tax payable for the period and the change in deferred tax. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rate at 22 % on the basis of tax - reducing and tax - increasing temporary differences that exist between accounting and tax values, and the tax loss carried forward at the end of the accounting year. Tax - increasing and tax - reducing temporary differences that reverse or may reverse in the same period are set off and entered net. The net deferred tax receivabl e is entered on the balance sheet to the extent that it is likely that it can be utilized. Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognized at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred that are directly attributable to the issuance of the financial liability. After initial recognition, borrowings are measured at amortized cost. Any difference between the net proceeds and the redemption amount is recognized in profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Classification and valuation of current assets Current assets and short - term liabilities consist normally of items that fall due for payment within one year of the balance sheet date, as well as items related to the normal operating cycle. Current assets are valued at the lower of acquisition cost and fair value. Short - term liabilities are recognized on the balance sheet at the nominal amount at the time of the transaction. Subsidiaries and associated companies Subsidiaries are accounted for using the cost method in the company accounts. The investment is recognised at acquisition cost for the shares unless a write - down has been necessary. A write - down to fair value is made when a fall in value is due to reasons that cannot be expected to be temporary and such writedown must be considered as necessary in accordance with good accounting practice. Write - downs are reversed when the basis for the write - down is no longer present. Dividends and group contributions from subsidiaries are normally recognized to income in the accounting year, as allowed by the Norwegian Accounting Act. For 2023, this option has not been utilized due to practical reasons, and no group contributions have been recognized in the financial statements for 2023.

The Group does not pay any principal until maturity date (October 2027), and interest is paid quarterly. Provided that reMarkable Invest AS is in compliance with certain ratios in relation to net interest bearing debt and EBITDA, reMarkable Invest AS has the possibility to issue up to additional NOK 500 million in bonds, subject to the same terms and conditions as the original bond, but with separate issuance process to be followed. reMarkable Invest AS has the possibility to early repay its bond at any time, with certain compensations to bondholders for lost interest, and the possibility to early repay up to 35% of the bond upon the Group's equity becoming listed. These options are f ound to be not closely related to the host contract, however it has been concluded that these options have negligible value for reMarkable Invest AS in the current circumstances. The bondholders also have the possibility of early repayment of the bond due to change of control or unfavorable tax events. These options are considered to be closely related to the host agreement and therefore they have not been separately recognized by reMarkable Invest AS.
