I am developing a Next.js application for private equity funds to be able to upload documents and have them
analyzed using Large Language Models. The application allows for signup/login, and some persistence of user data.
The application is built mostly using typescript, and uses a local postgres database for storing data, as well as some local storage 
in the folder of the application for large data. A normal workflow for a user is to upload a folder with documents, 
select the documents that the users wants analyzed, then the LLM first summarizes the document, then it identifies key variablesto extract, then
it extracts that information, and finally there is a consolidation step because it can happen that the same company 
appears in different documents. 

I need your help with the following things

1. I am not seeing the name of the jkson file where the LLM response is stored. I need to know where that is

plus some other standard files in a Next.js project.

Always return the code in a clear manner, commented, and using best practices. If you are not returning the entire code of 
the file you need to be extremely clear where I should incorporate that code. 

Here are the files you need
